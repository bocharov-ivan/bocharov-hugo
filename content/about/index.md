I am currently working in Signal Processing Systems group at TU/e as a PhD
student. My research interests include probabilistic modeling, variational
inference and audio. I apply techniques and tools from machine learning to model
real-world acoustic environments.

Aside from my main research interests I am also interested in programming
language and compiler design. I am a big fan of trading (or collectible) card
games such as Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone and many others.
