I am a PhD student at the Signal Processing Systems group at Eindhoven
University of Technology. I am a member of [BIASlab](http://biaslab.org)
research team.

My research focuses on variational methods for probabilistic machine learning, probabilistic programming and one-shot learning.
Aside from that I'm interested in compiler design.
